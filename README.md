# Data Science entry points

You can find many links about general data science on the [kaggle tutorial part](https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/Tutorials).

Some of links I tried and find interesting.

### datacamp MOOC
[Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/home) provides progamming courses for python or R for data science (MOOC). 

The course "Intro to python for data science" is entirely FREE and gives you inputs about python basics, python lists, functions and packages, and the *numpy* package.

There advanced courses that you can follow to learn about pandas, matplotlib or how to import and clean data in python. But thoses courses are partially free.

We can also follow those courses with R.
