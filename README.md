# Data Science entry points

You can find many links about general data science on the [kaggle tutorial part](https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/Tutorials).

Some of the links I tried and found interesting.

### datacamp MOOC
[Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/home) provides progamming courses for python or R for data science (MOOC). 

The course "Intro to python for data science" is entirely **FREE** and gives you inputs about python basics, python lists, functions and packages, and the **numpy** package.

There advanced courses that you can follow to learn about **pandas**, **matplotlib** or how to import and clean data using python. But thoses courses are partially free.

You can follow those courses with the **R** programming language as well.
